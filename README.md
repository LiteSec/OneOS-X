# OneOS: X Open Source Edition
This is a publication of the source code used to create the .ISO file previously available for download on our now defunct site, `oneos.litesec.co`.

Some minor changes have been made to the main `oneos.bat` file in order to improve stability on Windows 10, but for the most part, the code available in this repository is OneOS: X, exactly as it appeared in 2016.

On behalf of all of us at LiteSec, we hope you enjoy and cannot wait to see what the community can accomplish with OneOS: X.

Interested in why we've done this? Read our [blog post](https://litesec.co/blog/viewPost.php?id=1) about open-sourcing OneOS: X.
